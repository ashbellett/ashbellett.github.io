Let $$\underline{X}$$ be a random sample of size $$n$$ distributed according to the population $$\mathbb{P}_{X;\,\theta}$$ which depends on the parameter $$\theta.$$ A **hypothesis** $$H$$ is a statement about the true value of $$\theta.$$

A **simple hypothesis** assigns a single value to $$\theta$$ whereas a **composite hypothesis** states that $$\theta$$ takes a value in a given set. A simple hypothesis fully specifies the population $$\mathbb{P}_{X;\,\theta}$$ and the sampling distribution of any statistic is a function of $$n$$. A composite hypothesis does not fully specify $$\mathbb{P}_{X;\,\theta}.$$

A parameter space $$\Theta$$ where $$\theta\in\Theta$$ can be partitioned into two complementary regions $$\Theta_0$$ and $$\Theta_1$$ where $$\Theta_0\cap\Theta_1=\varnothing.$$ Two competing hypotheses are formed: the **null hypothesis** $$H_0:\theta\in\Theta_0$$ and the **alternative hypothesis** $$H_1:\theta\in\Theta_1.$$
