If a parameter vector $$\underline{\theta}$$ can be expressed in terms of the moments of the population $$\mathbb{P}_{X;\,\underline{\theta}}$$ then $$\underline{\theta}$$ can be estimated by equating the population moments with their corresponding sample moments using the **method of moments**:

1. Given a random sample $$\underline{X}$$ distributed according to the population $$\mathbb{P}_{X;\,\underline{\theta}}$$ and assuming $$\underline{\theta}$$ contains $$k$$ parameters to be estimated, the first $$k$$ sample moments are calculated.
2. The sample moments are equated with their corresponding population moments.
3. The system of equations is solved to find the unknown $$\underline{\theta}$$.
