A **logical statement** $$X$$ is a statement that is either true or false.

A statement $$X$$ is **necessary** for a statement $$Y$$, $$X \Leftarrow Y$$, if $$X$$ is required to be true for $$Y$$ to be true. Neccessity does not guarantee that $$Y$$ is true even if $$X$$ is true. Neccessary conditions are expressed as "$$X$$ if $$Y$$".

A statement $$X$$ is **sufficient** for a statement $$Y$$, $$X \Rightarrow Y$$, if $$X$$ being true guarantees that $$Y$$ is true. Sufficiency does not imply that $$X$$ is necessary for $$Y$$. Sufficient conditions are expressed as "$$X$$ only if $$Y$$".

If a statement $$X$$ is both necessary and sufficient for a statement $$Y$$, $$X \Leftrightarrow Y$$, then these statements are **logically equivalent**. Equivalent conditions are expressed as "$$X$$ if and only if $$Y$$".

The **negation** statement "$$X$$ is false" is true if and only if $$X$$ is false; otherwise the statement is false.

The **conjunction** statement "$$X$$ and $$Y$$" is true if and only if the statements $$X$$ and $$Y$$ are both true; otherwise the statement is false.

The **disjunction** statement "$$X$$ or $$Y$$" is true if either statement $$X$$ or $$Y$$ is true or both are true; otherwise the statement is false.
